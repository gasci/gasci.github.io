      <description>Has popular music truly changed over the last 50 years?
We bring something different this time. Would it be possible to show the evolution of popular music over the last five decades using visualizations?
We examined a dataset from Kaggle that contains more than 175.000 songs from the Spotify Website API. Find the link to the dataset below. Some of the most relevant variables:
 artists (List of artists mentioned) release_date (Date of release) name (Name of the song) acousticness (Ranges from 0 to 1) danceability (Ranges from 0 to 1) energy (Ranges from 0 to 1) duration_ms (Integer typically ranging from 200k to 300k) valence (Ranges from 0 to 1) popularity (Ranges from 0 to 100) loudness (Float typically ranging from -60 to 0) year (Ranges from 1921 to 2020)  After understanding the dataset with an Exploratory Data Analysis and applying some transformations, we created our figures.</description>

      <description>INTRODUCTION
Hiring data experts has become a challenging task for tech firms since their business demand a high number of data specialists. A way to attract talent can be paying higher wages. However, this is just one of the many factors, and probably not the most relevant one. Firms and employees understand that work is much more than giving your time in exchange of money. Although people might have different perspectives on the relevance of the factors that affect our overall job satisfaction, some of the most predominant are career opportunities, location, benefits, values, sector, management style and work-life balance.</description>

      <title>Project 2: Animated Figures. GDP and Life Expectancy</title>

      <description>GDP Evolution has always been one of my favourite topics. Why are some countries richer than others? Are poorer countries really catching up? The fact is that GDP per capita seems to be positively correlated with Life Expectancy, and I thought it would be valuable to visualize how they have evolved over the last decades.
The goal of this project is to dynamically visualize the GDP per capita evolution, life expectancy and population growth by continent over the years.</description>

      <description>In this project we explore the not-so-popular Parallel Coordinates charts. We selected the classic dataset “mtcars” which contains data extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend Magazine and has information about the performance of 32 cars on 11 different variables.
Our goal is to find unknown patterns that help distinguish between Automatic and Manual Transmission cars by its performance. We created two Parallel Coordinate figures with the following variables:
 qsec: ¼ mile time in seconds hp: Gross horsepower disp: Displacement (cu.</description>
